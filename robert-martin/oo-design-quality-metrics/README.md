# Design Quality Metrics by Uncle Bob

### Problem
What makes a design **rigid**, **fragile** and **difficult to reuse**.

1. A design is **rigid** if it cannot be easily changed. A single change causes a cascade of changes in dependant modules.
   
2. **Fragility** is the tendency of a program to break in many places when a single change is made.

3. A design is **difficult to reuse** when the desirable parts of the design are highly dependent upon other details which are not desired

### Example

There is a Copy class which depends on classes Keyboard and Printer. This system has all mentioned problems. We will encounter troubles in case we decide to change input or output.

In order to fix it, we have to change dependencies from classes to abstractions Reader and Writer (**Dependency Inversion**). Now out class Copy depends only on abstractions whicj have their own realizations.

> We can say that a "Good Dependency" is a dependency upon something that is very stable.

**Stability** is being achieved by an entity via becoming **independant** and **responsible**.

The less dependecies an entity has the more **independant** is it. From another side, the more dependants an antity has the more **responsible** is it. In other words, that antity is stable because has no reason to change and lots of reasonds not to change.

A group of highly cohesive classes could be called a **Class Category**.

Dependancies between categories are the ones that needs to be managed. The interdependace inside these categories is, so to say, something that could be sacrified.

The responsibility, independence and stability of a category can be measured by counting the dependencies that interact with that category. Three metrics have been identified:

- **Ca : Afferent Couplings** : The number of classes outside this category that depend upon classes within this category;
- **Ce : Efferent Couplings** : The number of classes inside this category that depend upon classes outside this categories;
- **I : Instability : (Ce รท (Ca+Ce))** : This metric has the range [0,1]. I=0 indicates a maximally stable category. I=1 indicates a maximally instable category.

To be stable and, at the same time, to have a possibility to be chaged, a category should include abstract classes.

A metric which mesaures the **abstractness** of a category can be defined:

**A : Abstractness** : (# abstract classes in category รท total # of classes in category). This metric
range is [0,1]. 0 means concrete and 1 means completely abstract.

No all Categories should be stable.

**Balanced** category is that one which can be situated on the **Main Sequence** (see graph in the article).
