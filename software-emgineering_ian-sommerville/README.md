A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software system. There is **no universal** software development process.

Each process must include the four fundamental software engineering activities:
1. *Software specification*: the functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.
2.  *Software development*: the software to meet the specification must be produced.
3.  *Software validation*: the software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.
4.  *Software evolution*: the software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.

### **Software process models**

A number of very general peocess models (process paradigms) are introduced. They could be thought of as process frameworks that may be extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.

1.  *The waterfall model*. This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, and testing.

2. *Incremental development*. This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.

3. *Integration and configuration*. This approach relies on the availability of reusable components or systems. The system development process focuses on configuring these components for use in a new setting and integrating them into a system.

### **Process activities**

1. **Software specification (requirements engineering)**
   1. Requirements elicitation and analysis
   2. Requirements specification
   3. Requirements validation
2. **Software design and implementation**
   1. Architectural design
   2. Database design
   3. Interface design
   4. Component selection and design
3. **Software validation**
   1. Component testing;
   2. System testing;
   3. Customer testing.
4. **Software evolution**

### **Coping	with	change**
The system requirements change depending on business needs. Software development process thus must have an ability to accommodate changes to the software being developed.
Two related approaches may be used to reduce the costs of rework:
1. Change anticipation;
2. Change tolerance.

Two ways of coping with change and changing system requirements are being discussed:

- **Systen prototyping**: where a version of the system or part of the system is developed quickly to check the customerâ€™s requirements and the feasibility of design decisions;
- **Incremental delivery**:  where system increments are delivered to the customer for comment and experimentation

### **Process improvements**
Two quite different approaches to process improvement and change are used:
1. **The process maturity approach**, which has focused on improving process and project management and introducing good software engineering practice into an organization. The primary goals of this approach are improved product quality and process predictability.
2.  **The agile approach**, which has focused on iterative development and the reduction of overheads in the software process. The primary characteristics of agile methods are rapid delivery of functionality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
