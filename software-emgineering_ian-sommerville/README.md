### Chapter 2

A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software system. There is **no universal** software development process.

Each process must include the four fundamental software engineering activities:
1. *Software specification*: the functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.
2.  *Software development*: the software to meet the specification must be produced.
3.  *Software validation*: the software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.
4.  *Software evolution*: the software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.

#### 2.1 Software process models

A number of very general peocess models (process paradigms) are introduced. They could be thought of as process frameworks that may be extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.

1.  *The waterfall model*. This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, and testing.

2. *Incremental development*. This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.

3. *Integration and configuration*. This approach relies on the availability of reusable components or systems. The system development process focuses on configuring these components for use in a new setting and integrating them into a system.
